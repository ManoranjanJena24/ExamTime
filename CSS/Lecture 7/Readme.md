we have to create style attribute in inline css

Q) Why i want to learn css --->because HTML doument koo achaa banana hai esliyee 



### INTERNAL CSS 
HTML is our root element
->It has 2 child  1)Head 2)Body
->inside head apply internal css by using <style><style/> tag

### inline css we have used style attribute whereas in 
#### internal css we will apply inside style tag



#### EXTERNAL CSS 

->firstly you have to create one file (whatever name you want  you can :))
->extension of the same file should be .css


### WHY TO SWITCH TO EXTERNAL CSS 
->because it increases code readdibility
