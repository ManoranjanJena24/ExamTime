### **Difference Between Margin and Positioning in CSS**  
   
for positioning you can only give 2 properties and also they should not be opposite otherwise it will not work at all means **LEFT AND RIGHT ❌❌**  OR **TOP AND BOTTOM ❌❌**

#box3{
    position: static;
    top: 20px;
    left: 10px;
    background-color: yellowgreen;
}
## As by default the position is static so we will not able to see 

position:relative   It remains in the normal flow only 
position:absolute normal flow see bahar aagayaa hai


## I should keep in mind jis bhee element kee position koo absolute banaaun  uskee parent koo relative banaun
